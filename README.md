Hey, I'm Dinesh!
</h1>

Alright, gather 'round for a tale. I once started down the very logical path of an Electronics and Computers Engineer. It was all resistors, signals and circuits until I got gloriously sidetracked by the siren song of the gaming world. I fell down the rabbit hole and came out the other side with an award-winning RPG I built from scratch. I even got to put on my best 'I know what I'm doing' face and pitch it to real-life VCs.

It was a blast, but somewhere between designing skill trees and fighting game-breaking bugs, I had an epiphany. The *real* final boss I wanted to fight was cloud infrastructure. So, in a life-changing plot twist, I hung up my game designer hat and went back to my roots, but with a powerful new upgrade.

Now, instead of building worlds for players, I build and maintain the worlds that services live in. It's awesome! I operate on a simple philosophy: a little bit of work today saves you from a "why is everything on fire?!" panic tomorrow. Plus, I aim to learn one new thing every single day. It keeps the brain from getting rusty and makes me surprisingly useful at trivia nights.

I'm a team player, I love feedback (it's just free cheat codes for getting better), and I'm always prepared. Seriously. I have backup plans for my backup plans. If that asteroid that got the dinosaurs ever comes back for round two, you'll want me on your team.

So, nice to meet you! Let's go build something amazing together.
